        <h2>Initial Renderings</h2>
        <p>Early 3D renderings drew inspiration from the Nintendo Wii remote and nunchuck, providing a familiar and ergonomic reference point. The intent was to reduce the learning curve by using forms already understood by gamers.</p>

        <h2>Form Development Challenges</h2>
        <p>During development, the team initially focused on a single ambidextrous concept. While inclusive, this approach constrained form factor flexibility. To address this, user testing and feedback were incorporated to refine the physical design around comfort, reachability, and hand fit.</p>
      </section>
    <section class="design-section">
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>User testing was conducted in two rounds to evaluate the ergonomics, usability, and comfort of the SPUD controller design. Each round provided valuable insights to refine the product form and user interaction.</p>
  
    <div class="user-testing">
      <h3>Round 1</h3>
      <p>The initial round of user testing was structured to guide the controllerâ€™s design direction. Participants were provided with a selection of buttons and modeling clay, and invited to freely prototype their vision of a one-handed controller tailored for first-person shooter (FPS) games.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="user-testing">
      <h3>Round 2</h3>
      <p>After revising the design, a second round of testing was conducted to validate improvements and assess long-term comfort. Changes based on feedback included grip contouring and button repositioning.</p>
